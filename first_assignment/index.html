	<h1>Meet the Hamburger Icon</h1>

	<p>We have all seen the hamburger icon. In fact, most of us probably use it on a daily basis. It has become a staple in website and app design.</p>

	<p>The hamburger icon is one of those UI features that's so old and so ubiquitous that it seems author-less. But someone did indeed design this visual nugget, and that was <a href="http://www.coxhall.com/bio.html" target="_blank">Norm Cox</a> from the Xerox Star.</p>

	<br />

	<p> Norm Cox is co-founder of Cox and Hall and has been an interface/experience design consultant since 1982. Here is what he said about his famous icon: </p>

	<p><em>"Its graphic design was meant to be very "road sign" simple, functionally memorable, and mimic the look of the resulting display menu list. With so few pixels to work with, it had to be very distinct, yet simple. I think we had 16x16 pixels to render the image."</em></p>

	<p>After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Star" target="_blank">Xerox Star</a> however, the hamburger icon disappeared for some time. It was only with the rising ubiquity of the much smaller interface that smartphones had that people were reminded of the icon's usefulness.</p>

	<p>Its reappearance was first seen in Voice Memos from iOS designed for the iPhone3Gs in 2009. Clicking on it would bring up the list of recordings and options.</p>

	<p>Facebook had also been a huge contributor in spreading the use of the hamburger icon for menus, who made the switch from their original grid icon in 2008.</p>

	<p>The icon held a lot of information inside it, and at the same time provided a consistent way to find extra information. But it was not without its shortcomings. When it was first widely reintroduced to users, they had a hard time figuring out its purpose.</p>

	<br />
	<br />

	<p>According to web developer James Foster's tests, adding the word "Menu" underneath increased the button's use by 7.2%.</p>

	<p>Enter 2012, the hamburger menu had been firmly established within responsive design as the go-to for navigation consolidation, and started creeping into desktop layouts. Designers saw how clean and simple their sites could be without the clutter of a three-tiered navigation filled with drop-downs, social icons, search bars, and utility links.</p>

	<br />

	<p>Then in the midst of its widespread use and appreciation, something happened.</p>

	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />

	<p>In recent years it had come under fire within the UI/UX community due to its use on desktop designs. The general consensus was that it tasted good, but was bad for you.</p>

	<br />
	<br />

	<p><strong>One of the problems pointed out was lower discoverability.</strong></p>

	<p>In an app or website's default state, the Sidebar Menu and all of its contents would remain hidden. People need to first be able to identify the Sidebar Menu as actionable and even though the hamburger icon has now become ubiquitously known, chances are that newcomers to UI would be more familiar with the word "Menu."</p>

	<br />
	<br />

	<p><strong>Another issue was reduced efficiency.</strong></p>

	<p>Even though people were aware and valued the feature, it was hard to get past that the hamburger icon introduced navigation friction since it forced people to first open the menu, which only then allowed them to see and reach their objective.</p>

	<p>Regardless, it's hard to deny that the hamburger icon has become a staple in both web and app design, and it doesn't look like it will be going anywhere anytime soon. It has made its comeback and is here to stay.</p>

	<p>In conclusion, maybe it's really more of a matter of how and when it is used.</p>
